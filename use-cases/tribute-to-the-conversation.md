One of the problems of social networks for large users is spam messages. These messages not only take up users' time but also confuse the messages.

Users can make money using the same idea as [onlyfans](https://onlyfans.com). Founded in 2016, the [onlyfans](https://onlyfans.com) project has attracted more than 200 million users and more than 1.5 million content producers, from which more than $ 5 billion has been transferred between individuals.

After finding people in the advertising platform in the application, and viewing the sample content, users will pay and communicate directly with the people in question.\
