# Monetize content



During the Corona, many physical businesses were destroyed by the presence of humans. These include many face-to-face schools, libraries, conferences, sports classes, and student education. There are currently many sites for online sales training that, firstly, the main profit goes into the pocket of the site administrator, and secondly, it is a very inefficient and unsuitable payment platform for non-resident users. In this system, users can generate the content locally and internationally and share it in groups, channels, and rooms in the software. Users can access the desired content by paying directly within the application.
