However, it should be noted that messengers are an excellent tool for conversational marketing to enhance customer experience and build brand loyalty via real-time conversation. Messengers provide perfect conditions for fast communication with the customer, and their expectations can be easily understood in conversation with them. On the other hand, One of the most critical issues in setting up a small business platform is to create the proper infrastructure to transfer money with the lowest fees and high speed. This payment platform accepted by individuals must be received by both parties, based on bargaining, credit of both parties, and the ability to convert into a variety of standard currencies.

On the other hand, The number of Blockchain wallet users globally has grown from less than a million in 2013 to [almost 81 million today](https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/), [a more than 8000% gain](https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/). Due to the availability of mobile phones and the habit of frequent use of messaging apps, they can be the best place for communications based on payment and the use of wallets.

In MetaTowers, users worldwide can produce their educational and entertainment content on the platform and determine at what cost, how long, and how different people access the content.

As the project's name indicates, users in the world of Metaverse can use this platform to purchase the MetaTowers units and decorate them with a variety of NFTs. Users can earn money by using a series of gamification-based measures, such as:

* Inviting different users to the system.&#x20;
* Producing and monetizing content
* Create Channels, groups, and rooms
* Producing different types of NFT in different platforms and selling them on this platform
* Staking tokens
