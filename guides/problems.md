# Problems

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** The dramatic growth of digital content production and the use of social media to offer and sell them, on the one hand, and the lack of bank accounts of more than [**1.7 billion people**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-bank-1-7-billion-152239354.html?guccounter=1\&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8\&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAACRSuVgt8erPYX9Bs6ledfRveks4rI5PWiqSEzX-7Sqalf5y26uBbPCrnBC2YF3RWg-3Ijs7rongvyyD2uwiHxuQAAkOoombbh\_U1\_2gmdY3fxM6qvFRcLns4WOvUmqU59Cjoosa8Gwv5TQ2ZdfHjyTp1akz4eCtC6WxoS-PLIxq) worldwide, on the other hand, has led to the MetaTowers project.

1. In the past few years, digital content creation and consumption have grown exponentially due to the new ways of fast communication and social media platforms. Many people active in this area are creating content with different purposes, such as educational and entertainment content. However, some gaps still need to be filled to grow this market further more. One other area that has experienced exponential growth in the past couple of years is subscription-based services. It looks like the future of digital content offering will most likely follow this path, and the best way to monetize user-created content can be through subscription services. Thus, the lack of a proper platform that offers monetization features for content creators and a simple, easy, and anonymous way for users to consume these contents can be a significant opportunity.
2. One of the biggest problems for people to offer their products internationally is the lack of a proper payment system for all the people around the world. Currently, international payment systems have many drawbacks that are not suitable for different users worldwide. Disadvantages such as late payment, high fees, and lack of variety in accepting foreign currencies are among the problems in current payment systems. Many users are reluctant to use such solutions.
3. Due to social networks, the spread of Internet penetration, and insecurity of information, many users tend to participate anonymously in cyberspace. Most virtual platforms receive complete identity information from individuals to allow the use of their services.&#x20;
4. Also, in the last two years, with the onset of the Covid epidemic, many physical businesses have closed or disappeared altogether. This Covid pandemic proved that traditional companies are very vulnerable and may not survive in today's world.
