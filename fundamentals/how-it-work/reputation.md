# Reputation

An important question that needs to be answered is: **How are people accredited?**

Each profile in the Meta tower has a reputation index that is measured based on the following factors:

·         Number and value of transactions in a specified period time.

·         Number and value of products, virtual assets, office in Meta tower, and content produced.

·         The points that buyers and sellers give each other after making a transaction.

·         Time to respond to buyers and sellers.

·         Total points obtained by introducing people to the app, groups, and channels.

Reputation gives you a better chance of taking advantage of good trading opportunities. For clarity, if A has a greater reputation than B, It will be placed higher on the advertisement list. Will have a better chance for them to make the deal.
