# MetaTowers Token

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** MetaTowers token is using messages as transactions for communication, and the use of this token to enable messaging is based on some principles that will be explained.
{% endhint %}

1\. All messages act as a transaction, whereby the parties stake $Tokens to communicate with each other. All senders use $Tokens to be able to send messages.&#x20;

\
2\. Using a [single token eliminates the risk of exogenous price fluctuations](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/conferences/shared/pdf/retpaym\_150604/polasik\_paper.pdf) in other cryptocurrencies that would cause messaging between users to potentially change their wallet values. The stability of $Tokens is preserved, as its value would only depend on the ecosystem's services, size, transaction volume, and messaging volume.\


&#x20;3\. $Tokens are used for messaging/file storage services or trading purposes; users can also earn tokens. This can be done by completing specific incentivized actions, including:&#x20;

\- Onboarding subscribers to personal channels/groups, etc.&#x20;

\- Sharing content paid for advertisers to a contact list.&#x20;

\- Inviting successfully new users to join meta towers.&#x20;

\- Create some accessories and furniture for MetaTowers.&#x20;

\- Create a broadcast advertisement.

\- Generate bills.&#x20;
