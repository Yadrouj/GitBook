#### What Can You Do in the Metaverse, Exactly? <a href="#what-can-you-do-in-the-metaverse-exactly" id="what-can-you-do-in-the-metaverse-exactly"></a>

The point of avatars is to gain access to this virtual world since you canâ€™t traverse it yourself. And once you get there, you have the world at your fingertips.

Meta and other companies currently envision it; the metaverse is a complete parallel virtual world from our own. You can do just about anything in the metaverse that you could do in real life, including (in theory, anyway) an utterly digital economy where users can make, buy and sell goods.&#x20;

There are many office and home appliances that users can purchase to equip their offices and units. Can buy a branch and then fit it with available items by paying a token-based fee. Home users who have the ability to produce products can share their products in these towers and earn money by making NFT-based products.\


Since many people world would have lost their business during the Corona era, as well as people who do not have a valid bank account, they can earn NFT by building these offices and towers. Make money and eventually get a loan.
